# Blackjack

The objective of Blackjack, also known as Twenty-One, is to beat the dealer by getting a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, without going over 21. 

# How to Win

**Objective:**

Aim to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
Beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
Card Values:

Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each.
Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, whichever is more favorable.

**Game Setup:**

Played with one or more standard 52-card decks.
Each player places a bet before any cards are dealt.
Dealing Cards:

Each player is dealt two cards, face up.
The dealer is dealt two cards: one face up, one face down (the "hole" card).

**Player's Turn:**

Players decide whether to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
Players can continue to hit until they decide to stand or exceed 21 (bust).

**Dealer's Turn:**

Once all players have completed their turns, the dealer reveals their hole card.
The dealer must hit until their hand totals 17 or higher.
If the dealer busts, all remaining players win.

**Winning the Game:**

If a player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's without busting, the player wins.
If the player and dealer have the same hand value, it's a "push" (tie), and the player's bet is returned.
If the dealer has a higher hand value without busting, the dealer wins.

**Blackjack:**

If a player is dealt an Ace and a 10-value card as their initial two cards, they have a "blackjack" and typically win 1.5 times their bet, unless the dealer also has a blackjack, resulting in a push.

**Basic Strategy:**

Players can use strategies based on the dealer's visible card to decide when to hit or stand.
Common strategies involve hitting on lower totals and standing on higher totals, especially when the dealer shows a weak upcard (like 4, 5, or 6).
